5,"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Electric Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",lets just begin with the obvious this phone s quality doesn t meet the claims made cons camera quality picture quality is just awful its worse than a mp camera the pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a mp camera do not believe the claims samsung might make the quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when vga cameras were common battery samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long no netflix prime video heavy games being used so that makes two of the biggest features useless amazon s policy in case you don t like the phone amazon has made sure you are stuck with it the switch from day return policy to day replacement policy is dowright wrong hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores your days are not over yet when you do request for replacement there is an inspection of the phone at buyer s site which i understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease pros display the screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light performance streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first days but then again samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance so i will keep my eyes and ears open sound speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark in a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom,0

9,"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Electric Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",may be my first negative review about the product amazon both i was much elated to receive the iphone so fast next day of dispatch i e but the thing i got started heating up every now and then contacted applecare just to be consoled that it s quite normal as it continued tried to return the product by speaking to amazon customer support but in vain some body called me back to convey that only apple will decide which one to take back why is then amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can t exchange have no control the product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute even had two software updates it was handed over to the apple asp as the return window closed on what use it was for and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to apple repair facility at bengaluru so i m here w out my first iphone after using it suffering for just a little over weeks and the credit goes to amazon bravo keep it up amazon,0

26,"Vivo Y91i (Black, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)",as a tech and apple enthusiast this is one beautiful piece of tech and engineering marvel from its seem less design to its attention to minute details thx to the designing team behind it it will force you to agree that its insane price tag is justified the moment you hold it i can never believe myself of how much my views have changed about this product and apple from it release to the moment i had it in my hands well if you want to know specs and comparisons well you have youtube there are plenty of reviews there but if you are ready to buy such an expensive piece without selling your kidney then those reviews and comparisons don t matter to you i guess my review camera trustworthy reliable takes very aggressive hdr shots at times but generally neutral with its performance you will find yourself editing the pictures a lot and i never complained it as i love doing it and when the base material is so detailed and accurate to begin with that you never lose any significant amount of quality after many editing cycles battery respectable af never expected this from a sub par capacity battery while it is not the best its at a very respectable position for sure it surely will surprise you once you use it speed the king of phones in speed period design negatives face id doesn t work in landscape charges slow,0
27,"Vivo Y91i (Black, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)",go for it undoubtedly the best mobile of so far pros camera a specially selfie camera with ai technology where you will find features like face slim nose slim chin slim d bigger eyes and others i bet you will like it much better than vivo internal memory and ram a build quality a battery a holding charge including heavy usage and game play till days easily charging a some says it doesn t support fast charging but it is neither a normal or slow charging it s not a super fast charging but a good fast charging sound a in one word awesome sound comes as d surround sound type previously i used small speakers whenever i used to see movies on amazon prime even in my iphone but now no need of speakers superb dolby digital sound quality cons only the display quality but it is negligible,1
28,"Vivo Y91i (Black, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)",the phone was wrapped in dust although it was seal packed still many dust were on screen and back side it shows security concerns and amazon samsung and seller must draw its attention how dust can be reached in seal packed box now i m lacking trust in amazon samsung and seller either my phone was used or its components might have replaced as in brand new phone there exists no dusts because they are built in factory but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product phone is nice large battery backup of more than days display is big camera is perfect and gb ram is enough for daily usage all things are good no heating issue however my only concern is dust and how it came there if its brand new so i could give star but now is enough beware of amazon samsung and seller,0

32,"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Electric Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",a lengthy brutally honest review it s worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device i am a design specialist by profession also into mobile photography hence i was hooked in using the pixel xl this phone is a worthy upgrade if you re transitioning from galaxy s pixel or series oneplus t below iphone x or and below oneplus t pro is only an incremental upgrade over it s predecessor oneplus pro what has been improved over the pro faster processor snapdragon plus adreno better gaming performance better haptic motor same as the t fast charging warp t technology brighter nits upto compared to of pro super macro mode night reading modes android out of the box better nightscape these software updates will be eventually updated for the pro as well what s in the box oneplus t pro device user manual transparent silicon case sim ejector tool warp t charging brick type c usb cable and some cool oneplus stickers display firstly oneplus t pro has a stunning display over its predecessors i m personally not a fan of notches nor do i click a lot of selfies so i prefer the oneplus t pro s fluid display feels more luxurious over the t it s marginally bigger to hold as well i would recommend using a case so that the edges don t feel slippery however you should also note that in different lighting conditions t pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which i believe is negligible hz is smoooooth you would never want to get back to hz once you re used to this performance snapdragon plus is one of the best cpus out there at the time of writing this review and with adrena it takes gaming and multi tasking to another league cod pub g juices out at their best with fps is indeed smooth than imagined plus is at par with the a bionic from apple haven t experienced any drops in frames ram management is splendid gb ram is recommended unless you want to get the gig mclaren edition to save on a few seconds everyday camera i honestly have to admit that it s not the best out there as i was expecting a leap from it s predecessors it still uses the sony imx mp for it s main sensor and it s telephoto at x optical x lossless and is at par with iphone but when compared with the gcam mod the oneplus camera seems to have improved a lot from it s previous versions the wide angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges nightscape is now available for wide angle shots too video if you re into video recording then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn t the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the ois and eis at p and just ois at k fps it still doesn t shoot k in wide angle apple iphone takes the lead here ois and eis combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers it s still not an alternate for a gimbal the videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a third party app like filmic pro software this is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the oneplus stock android was butter smooth while i missed out on a lot of simple gestures like longer screenshots silence button customized navigational elements much more which lacked on the stock os from google i would say oxygen os should be set as a benchmark for google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships oxygen os has presently the best os experience for android battery warp t is super fast it helps you charge from in lesser time than an episode on netflix although not the fastest charger in the industry it still gets through a day on heavy usage what could ve been improved minor improvements on camera no tof sensor no wireless charging ip rating better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades verdict no doubt that the asus fans would recommend the rog rog is hands down the best gaming phone with hz display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates telephoto camera splash proof build quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers asus is also not known to provide regular updates to it s consumers over the oneplus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more brand value than asus nevertheless to mention that the oneplus t pro feels premium out of the box if you re planning to upgrade from a device almost years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no notch and curved screen t pro feels very slippery when compared to the t i wish they made smaller devices otherwise i would still recommend the t which is the best bang for your buck if you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates fast charging plus my suggestion would be is to go for the oneplus pro it s still one of the best devices out there,1

263,OnePlus 5 (Slate Gray 8GB RAM + 128GB Memory),firstly thank you amazon for the quick delivery the iphone if compared with its predecessors iphone is truly a powerhouse when it comes to performance the a bionic chip has played an absolute role in maximising the efficiency of the iphone as for the battery it s always better to turn off the mobile data or wi fi on an iphone when not in use to make the battery last longer than usual when it comes to make a choice between an iphone and an iphone plus i d personally recommend the the screen size is pretty decent fits in your pocket well at the same time the iphone maintains the essence of an iphone however if you re into larger phones or photography dual camera the portrait mode the plus is a great option the all glass panel makes the iphone a bit heavier than the iphone however it adds to the style making the device look more premium again the true tone display feature too has played a vital role in viewing the screen definitely helps in easing the eyes i m not really into photography so wouldn t comment about the camera but the iphone cameras have always been the eye candy for almost everyone i d also like to thank the seller worldwide store for his prompt response to my queries if you re hesitant about the other sellers buy it from the worldwide store,1

553,"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",personally i feel the xs is a complete phone my last iphone worked flawlessly for yearsi was confused between note xs one plus t and other latest handsets finally chose ios over android as it is more polished than android and the apps in my opinion work better on an iosdid not go for the max as i prefer the smaller size price is definitely high and i got it in a nice deal from amazon which knocked off k on the price tagplus got free screen replacement cover no interest emitips wait for a sale to get maximum savings this phone is worth it if you are getting it at a good deal get a cover,0

555,"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",decent packaging and shipping upgraded from an iphone x and i reckon its definitely worth it size matters no pun intended and you can instantly feel the difference b w a inch screen and a inch if you have an iphone x or earlier model you should definitely consider upgrading for iphone xs max you are better off waiting for next year model as its touted to undergo some radical changes g usb c touch id comeback and notch less design perhaps no g in this model but doesn t make a difference at least in india as even the g spectrum has not been auctioned yet wifi performance is better than iphone x as this model supports ax protocol and by the way if you are stuck for choice b w gold and midnight green go for gold and thank me later,0
556,"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",yea pre ordered on july got it on august package was nice without any damage so here is my first impression display is so nice and hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth camera is okay but not upto the mark macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap wide angle is okay but images are too smooth without any crispness fps video recording at k is not there at rear cam but is present for front cam don t know why they did that premium user experience face unlock and in display fingerprint is good phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame the signature slide button delivers the same good experience okay so if you feel that you need a g chipset and be future proof definitely go for it if you want a flagship perfomance go for k pro or oneplus t as this wont be a good choice for heavy users but still a good experience in regards of games for a short run cod in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops because it got an overclocked gpu stilli am satisfied with what i got here updated excellent charging speed thanks to warp charge to in less than an hour battery backup is so good for daily users lasts almost a day no serious heating issues at all this is a mid range phone one of the best and should not expect a monster perfomance from it one of the best choice as a daily driver if heavy perfomance is not your priority,1
557,"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",when i was testing my device for any display issues i kind of felt white colors are a bit too warm which looked like it had some tint effect to it in my unit so i went into display settings and changed the calibration to advanced and selected amoled wide gamut with a cool color tone it seemed to be good and then after a while i started noticing image retention issue which was visible in light gray background so i tested it keeping full brightness and opening chrome incognito mode and i could see home screen icons visible there as shown in picture i called in for replacement but unfortunately i can only get a refund due to low stock of op prodisappointed a lot in the quality of oneplus devices for which we pay k,0
558,"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",i have recieved this phone on th of august and today is th of august so after days i am reviewing this phone because i have seen many negative reviews on amazon review portal so now my true experience is about this phone following processor media tek quad core is best because quad core take less power from battry than the octa core processor and i purchased this phone for my mom so quad core porcessor is sufficient to my mom battry life is good because of quad core processor ram is gb that is also sufficient display as always awesome as samsung provide mike and speaker s quality is too good as always samsung provide many people said in the review that the mobile is automatically swiched off and on automatically yes i have seen this my own only one time but its not the problem every new phone have done this one time because of system works smoothly and after one time switch off on things happen then never repeated till my days of use this phone so you people who is taking switch off on problem very seriously you should not this is one time process when phone is new sometimes phone may swich off and on automatically so dont panik at all for this most of the people want to replace the phone because of one time switch off on problem then i have to say one thing that your first phone is the only phone who is brand new and the replaced phone never be a new phone at all so never replace your new phone this is my own experience i am fully satisfied from this phone in this price of this is all the reason that is why i am giving star this phone thank u samsung,1

561,"Samsung Galaxy M51 (Celestial Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",firstly i am glad i have purchased this phone for people confused between xs and xs max take the xs why because xs max doesnt give you more screen space it just enlarges the icons and the text even after upgrading the ios to there seems to be no difference i think the screen could have been used to fit in more text compared to the xs having said that im used to big phones the pixel xl the splus so if you are a big phone person go for this phone with eyes closed if you are confused between apple and android flagships let me tell you i was on htc for years then shifted to iphone s plus for years and briefly shifted to pixel xl and now finally to xs max which i intend to use for the next years having used both i definitely feel iphones are quite premium and offer the best tech i mean when i think about it who invented face id who designed the notch almost all phones come with these features these days and after adapting to iphones technology the other phones are going a step ahead so definitely apple is the trend setter comparing pixel xl with xs max i found that the pixel xl and even the pixel get damn hot definitely not the issue on the iphone iphone looks much better too great display also great touch interface its really smooth having said that its all personal choice i really love my purchase and now i know why some people are reluctant to switch to android from iphone,0

693,Apple iPhone 8 (128GB) - Gold,i purchased this iphone space grey gb on december i got it for k i saw the price just now has gone down to k so i thought i would write a review about it for almost years of use well i got this phone when iphone x was just introduced but as it was much expensive then i went along with iphone and i have not been disappointed with my choice the phone is working in the best possible way as it has been just bought yesterday not a single da has i have got any software issues lag issues aware issues nothing at all it has been a smooth experience so far and i am looking forward to use it for another years more asince i am interested in street photography the camera works pretty good for me though the glass back feels very slippery and it is actually but since i always use a back cover so it wasn t an issue for me i have not used it for much of gaming so i have never faced any heating issues but i do have used it for prolonged period of time and i have not felt any discomfort one thing which people kind of neglect in iphone is the earphones provided with the phone the earphones are of pretty good quality and hence should not be taken for granted in fact the microphone is pretty awesome to record your music or your songs it is very sensitive and can record even a whisper as i use macbook air so the interaction with my laptop has been pretty good all in all i don t regret buying it as the prices have gone down quite a lot now so if anyone out there wants to get a premium perfect size bezel phone i would recommend iphone let me know if there are any specific questions about it,0

704,Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max (512GB) - Space Grey,the mobile display on the screen has vanished and no images are visible on the screen even when the instrument was used sparingly for watching videos on you tube since it was delivered to me on th june only two months back on making a search on google it appears that many other buyers have also faced similar problems with this model it appears that there is some manufacturing defect and therefore the instrument needs to be replaced immediately i have already lodged my complaint no dtd with the customer care department of the company i have been given to understand that the instrument will be repaired free of cost but since the malfunction damage has occurred within the warranty period of one year i would like the instrument to be replaced forthwith,1
705,Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max (512GB) - Space Grey,i will rate one start for this product my experience of using this phone for one week is sub par multiple times in this one week this phone hanged many time even home screen was hanged i have installed only five additional apps quora amazon facebook whatsapp and google maps please refrain from purchasing this phone it is waste of money,0
706,Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max (512GB) - Space Grey,decent packaging and shipping upgraded from an iphone x and i reckon its definitely worth it size matters no pun intended and you can instantly feel the difference b w a inch screen and a inch if you have an iphone x or earlier model you should definitely consider upgrading for iphone xs max you are better off waiting for next year model as its touted to undergo some radical changes g usb c touch id comeback and notch less design perhaps no g in this model but doesn t make a difference at least in india as even the g spectrum has not been auctioned yet wifi performance is better than iphone x as this model supports ax protocol and by the way if you are stuck for choice b w gold and midnight green go for gold and thank me later,0
707,Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max (512GB) - Space Grey,finally i decided to go with apple as it now has an led screen instead of ips lcd screens that iphone and previous versions had i also used my dads iphonex for around months and decided to go for this when i was convinced though it is expensive i believe its worth the money i feel its much more secure than android and its not forcing me to have facebook youtube etc that my previous samsung phones always did just to let y ll know that i was a big fan of samsung i have used note s s edge etc though its screen was good they use to slow down after some time of use i purchased an apple only after positive reviews from my friends and i am loving this so far gb ram in iphone x or gb ram here in iphone xs is far better than gb ram in a samsung i also play pubg and i am also loving the gaming experience very important it runs on high graphics mode where as my note use to work on medium graphics even when i used the mobile on gaming high performance or entertainment mode so i am loving my iphone so far and the face id is just awesome,0

714,Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max (512GB) - Gold,initial impression after using for one day the display is gorgeous feels like a high end device specs say mah battery power management is not up to the mark without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable hopefully samsung will release a patch to fix this camera impressive good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots struggles a bit during the low light conditions overall quite ok for the price processor not the fastest out there but does the job nothing to complain about fingerprint scanner is decent no back case in the box will take time to get new case delivered case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery i believe the cost should have around k instead of k but if you want a non chinese phone then this is a good option to consider,1

772,"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",i like the camera quality images and videos are sharp and clear there is a wee bit of noise in low light areas but it can be overlooked it looks quite a bit like the iphone x but is largerdisplay is on par with iphone xmusic sounded as good as iphone xi could just unbox and get on with it as oppo provided the tempered glass back cover as well which was a pleasant surprise as i was not expecting also the design finger print sensor on display face recognition lot of features dual g standy by with an sd card is a blessing and i was looking for exactly what this phone offered at the right price and also the back cover made of leather is so freaking rich and classy quite happy with what i got this is probably the fastest decision i have ever taken around buying a phone and i am hoping this will last long like most of my other phones,1
773,"Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)",go for it undoubtedly the best mobile of so far pros camera a specially selfie camera with ai technology where you will find features like face slim nose slim chin slim d bigger eyes and others i bet you will like it much better than vivo internal memory and ram a build quality a battery a holding charge including heavy usage and game play till days easily charging a some says it doesn t support fast charging but it is neither a normal or slow charging it s not a super fast charging but a good fast charging sound a in one word awesome sound comes as d surround sound type previously i used small speakers whenever i used to see movies on amazon prime even in my iphone but now no need of speakers superb dolby digital sound quality cons only the display quality but it is negligible,1

788,Apple iPhone 11 (128GB) - Black,pros clean and bloatfree oxygenos which runs as smooth as they come amoled screen and hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage sound quality is good and modestly loud drawback in cons the design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth and a bit more on length all the more better viewing experience gaming performance is average similar phones in this range have better gaming performances the phone looks and feels premium while using the alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes face unlock is as fast as other oneplus phones very very fast cons the camera is not as good as it was expected the macro lens is pretty useless and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren t as vibrant as oneplus a bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots k video recording fps is absent but fps performance is quite good the camera is better than most phones out there but it isn t what we were promised no headphone jack the mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone which tends to get covered by your hand while using also being on just one side of the phone the audio isn t as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker no expandable memory slot the plastic frame doesn t look like plastic but it is is a worrying thing and makes the phone comparatively less durable fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn t as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back recommendation if you re looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use go for it but if your prime purpose is gaming there are better options available also if you re expecting flagship camera performance you might want to consider other phones pixel a is about to release that s far better probably update pixel a camera is surely much better that nord s camera,0
789,Apple iPhone 11 (128GB) - Black,writing this review after using the phone since august it was difficult to get into android after using iphone but never regret this buy for the below points finger print sensors are with good speed faster application speed than all the other phones found better speed than my iphone good app interface can t beat iphone in this aspect yet doesn t compromise i have installed apps and yet it doesn t hang for any games games like assassin s creed run real smooth recommend to buy it if you are looking for a phone below k,0

805,Apple iPhone 11 (128GB) - Purple ,display quality is top notch overall the quality of the phone is very good all metal body camera is good too touch smoothness is amazing i will definitely recommend to buy this phone the usb is not type c it is the old one this is the only con that i found till now it has got nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot other than the phone amazon delivery service is a bit let down it took days to deliver the item from calcutta to assam whereas last year i bought redmi note for me and my uncle from flipkart and mi india website if you recall mi had flash sale every friday hence i bought both handset on different dates to my surprise i placed the order on friday and received the item on sunday on one occasion and monday on the other occasion which the shipped through ekart and fedex respectively merely in i got my phone but amazon s courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and fedex,1

809,Apple iPhone 11 (128GB) - Purple ,everything is fine g is really good for battery the one thing that annoys me is gb is way too low storage where used by system itself and then welcome to bloatware u can t delete apps like netflix and fb or some of google app which is really useless i barely use netflix on phone after all that u get only gb of use there is also some technical glitch regarding to oneplus s so called gb cloud storage i m still unable to get this benefit including device protection through oneplus care camera is superb as expected display is in the top notch charging is awesome i e really fast,0
810,Apple iPhone 11 (128GB) - Purple ,processor the oneplus is the first phone in india to have the advanced octacore nanometer design qualcomm snapdragon chipset combined with the gb or gb for the gb variant of ram it can not only render graphics faster but is also more battery efficient camera oneplus also comes bundled with a dual camera setting while the front camera is of megapixel the two rear cameras are a combination of a megapixel lens and a megapixel telephoto lens both the lens is made by sony and the primary camera has an aperture of f while the secondary camera has an aperture of f the telephoto lens will offer up to x zoom and both the lenses will combine together to capture impressive photos with a greater depth of field akin to the portrait mode of the iphone plus dash charge in the fast paced world the faster the phone charges the better it is and the oneplus s dash charge proves that point beyond a doubt just like the oneplus t the oneplus also comes packed with the mighty dash charger the dash charge is capable of charging the phone from in just mins and that s more than impressive os the oxygen os software has been updated to oreo in the last week that we have been using it it adds some light useful and tasteful customizations on top of stock android that add value it s not easy to get the software right and it s impressive how oneplus can strike the right balance so early in the game i particularly find gestures including alternate actions you can assign to navigation keys and the left home screen pane very helpful battery and audio the mah battery on the oneplus can comfortably last for one moderate usage day on particular heavy usage days you will have to resort to mid day charging the dash charge is incredibly fast as ever and will prove to be a big convenience it however works only with the inbox charger and cable the loudspeaker on the phone is present on the bottom edge it s quite average in terms of loudness but the audio quality is reasonable audio output via headphones is very good the call quality on the phone is excellent but after so much some things got missed like ois camera stabilizer not ips certified k display resolution also dual camera needs some fixesbut over all its a power packed phone with a reasonable price and t has made some improvements on camera which are missing on but front fingerprint scanner lover chosse oneplus thats all hope i have helped a lot,1

847,Apple iPhone X (256GB) - Space Grey,hi guys in general the phone is nice and does manages to provide you the feeling of a premium phone however there are some flaws which i witnessed over my experience till date so let me provide you the pros and cons of the phone pros nice built quality and comfortable to hold excellent performance symmetric stereo speakers better experience while watching videos or playing games nice camera with with very good quality low light or night photography which still many flagship phones lack up to the mark hz refresh rate display amoled screen brightness is excellent and there is no issue in viewing display even while the display is directly facing towards the sun excellent charging with watts wired and wireless charging i tried charging the phone from dead to and achieved it just under hour in my personal opinion i don t think higher charging wattage like watts is good for phone battery and sounds like a gimmick as even though they have double the wattage they usually charge a phone of smaller battery about mah in about minutes which is not much of a difference super steady video from rear camera because of presence of both eis ois bigger battery mah as compared to other flagship phones doesn t misses out on any feature like reverse wireless charging g support though in india not of use for at least couple of years nfc dual gps capable of being connected to wifi and provide hotspot simultaneously no miui ads till date cons the limitation of resolution of the screen fhd the bigger size of the screen results in lower ppi and thus stands nowhere near qhd displays this phone comes with global miui and has google dialer and messaging app thus misses out features like call recording phone notes etc reason being in many countries like uae it is illegal to have call recording apps or vpn apps trust me this miui has a lot of bugs and thus results in issues like while using finger print scanner the device heats up at times even during normal usage but the overall performance is acceptable hopefully most of the issues will be resolved by miui update which is going to be available soon outdated front camera and supporting rear cameras hardware the mp front camera and that too without eis mp macro camera mp depth camera and mp ultrawide camera seems like a joke for a flagship phone with the price of k the battery is bigger compared to many devices but looses about to even when left untouched overnight thus i d say not so good battery management misses out a mm jack and also the c type to mm jack converter provided in the box doesn t seem to be of a very good quality as per my initial impression though the low light photography is good but daylight photography is not that exceptional as one might expect from mp camera i felt that the call quality is not up to the mark maybe just in my case pricing issues though there are two things which have gone against xiaomi as well as other mobile brands increment in gst rates from to higher import duties for imported phones i think that the phone is slightly overpriced at k but if we compare it with it s biggest competitor the one plus i will always choose mi as so many things are missing in one plus like wireless charging lp ddr ram x is present instead of comes with smaller battery mah and sony imx camera sensor which is quite outdated now and have a price difference of only k even that can be narrowed down by using bank offers if available which was there in my case however in comparison with one plus pro i feel that mi is slightly behind because of the miui bugs related flaws fhd display and outdated secondary camera hardware including front camera thus i believe that if the aforementioned issues would have been addressed by xiaomi i would have considered this phone justifying the price completely and without a doubt would have been the best phone ever under k however in reality still the phone is definitely a strong competitor in the flagship mobile segment,0
